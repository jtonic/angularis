### JS based application - solely for learning purpposes

### GOALS
1. Learn javascript technologies such as:

    programming language - including the new ECMAScript 6

    MVC frameworks  - AngularJS, lodash, karma, jasmine, )

    app framework - node js

    BDD framework - Jasmine

    TESTS runner - Karma

    TASKS runner - Gulp

    Project generation (scaffolding) yeoman

    Functional programming with JS

    Object Oriented programming with JS

    Programming patterns with JS

    JS modules with AMD/RequireJS, NodeJS/CommonJS, ECMA6 modules


### How to run the app
1. TODO
1. Access the app at TODO

### Tasks
1. [NEXT] Asynchronous programming with promises in ECMAScript 6
1. [DONE] Enable the tasks runner gulp
1. [ONGOING] Functional programming with ECMA JS 6
1. [DONE]Functional data types - functors
1. Functional data types - monads
1. [DONE] Modules in NodeJS with CommonJS
1. [DONE] BDD tests with jasmine. The jasmine based bdd tests have been configured to run in watch mode with gulp-watch plugin
1. [DONE] RequireJS support
1. [DONE] AngularJS simple page
1. Karma testing
1. Protractor
1. [ONGOING] lodash examples:
    1. [DONE] copy properties/functions from on object to another. (_.assign())
1. [ONGOING] Object oriented programming in ECMAScript 5.1 and 6
1. Fix the problem of [08:04:41] Error in plugin 'gulp-jasmine' => show the runtime problem not this strange exception
1. [ONGOING] OOP in JS




#### Notes:
The backend side javascript requires ECMAScript 6 NodeJS 4+

#### Useful  gulp plugins:
1. **gulp-nodemon** - incrementally run tasks

#### Links
1. protractor https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/
